# metacleaner

A local, offline metadata cleaner and AI-tag remover, written in Rust, for
images, plain text/Markdown, HTML, and Office documents.

- **Images** (JPEG, PNG, WebP, BMP, GIF, TIFF): strips EXIF, GPS, XMP, IPTC,
  C2PA content credentials, and AI-generator signatures (Stable Diffusion
  `tEXt`/`iTXt`/`zTXt` chunks, DALL-E/Midjourney/Adobe Firefly fingerprints),
  and can optionally reset the pixel-level fingerprint of the output so old
  copies can't be hash-matched back to the source file. Also does classical
  (Lanczos3) and real AI (Real-ESRGAN, bundled, via ONNX Runtime)
  super-resolution upscaling.
- **Text/Markdown** (`.txt`/`.md`): strips invisible-Unicode steganography
  (zero-width characters, bidi overrides, Unicode Tag block smuggling,
  variation-selector smuggling) and, for `.md`, AI/tool-identifying
  frontmatter keys (`author`, `generator`, etc.).
- **HTML** (`.html`/`.htm`): strips identifying `<meta>` tags (`generator`,
  `author`, `dc.creator`, ...) and non-conditional comments — the invisible-
  Unicode pass above applies here too.
- **Office documents** (`.docx`/`.xlsx`/`.pptx`): strips author, company,
  last-modified-by, and custom tracking properties from `docProps/*.xml`,
  leaving document content byte-for-byte untouched.

A separate `inspect` (and per-format `inspect-text`/`inspect-doc`)
subcommand reports what's present in a file without modifying it. A `serve`
subcommand runs a local web UI (drag-and-drop, batch, download) at
`http://127.0.0.1`, bound to loopback only, with options that adapt to
whatever file type you drop.

No network calls, no server upload — everything runs on your machine.

## Install

### Debian / Ubuntu (apt)

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://siddhantbhattarai.github.io/metacleaner/pubkey.gpg \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/metacleaner.asc > /dev/null

echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/metacleaner.asc] https://siddhantbhattarai.github.io/metacleaner stable main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/metacleaner.list

sudo apt update
sudo apt install metacleaner
```

This adds a dedicated apt source signed with a repo-specific GPG key (not a
global `apt-key` entry) — standard practice for third-party apt
repositories. The repo itself (`Packages`/`Release`/`InRelease`, GPG-signed)
is published at <https://siddhantbhattarai.github.io/metacleaner/> via
GitHub Pages, built from the `.deb` this project's `cargo deb` produces (see
[Package as a `.deb`](#package-as-a-deb) below).

### From source

See [Build](#build) below — `cargo build --release --workspace` or
`cargo deb -p metacleaner-cli` if you'd rather build the `.deb` yourself.

## Why full decode/re-encode instead of parsing each metadata format?

JPEG APPn segments, PNG ancillary chunks, and WebP RIFF metadata chunks are
all *container-level* data that sits alongside — not inside — the pixel
data. Rather than hand-parsing every known tag scheme (EXIF, XMP, IPTC,
C2PA/JUMBF, plus whatever the next AI tool invents), `metacleaner-core`
fully decodes the image to raw pixels and re-encodes it from scratch. The
encoder only ever writes geometry + pixel data, so every non-pixel segment
is dropped by construction — including formats this tool has never heard of.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release --workspace
# binary at target/release/metaclean
```

### Package as a `.deb`

```bash
cargo install cargo-deb   # one-time
cargo deb -p metacleaner-cli
# package at target/debian/metacleaner_<version>-1_amd64.deb

sudo apt install ./target/debian/metacleaner_*.deb
# or: sudo dpkg -i target/debian/metacleaner_*.deb
```

The `metaclean` binary is fully self-contained — the AI model and web UI
assets are embedded via `include_bytes!`/`include_str!`, and ONNX Runtime
is statically linked (no `libonnxruntime.so` at runtime) — so the package
needs no postinst script and depends on nothing beyond `libc6`/`libstdc++6`
(auto-detected by `dpkg-shlibdeps` via the `depends = "$auto"` setting in
`crates/metacleaner-cli/Cargo.toml`'s `[package.metadata.deb]`). After
installing, `metaclean` and `metaclean serve` are on your `PATH`.

## Usage

`metaclean` has a read-only/destructive pair of subcommands per file type:
`inspect`/`clean` for images, `inspect-text`/`clean-text` for `.txt`/`.md`/
`.html`/`.htm`, and `inspect-doc`/`clean-doc` for `.docx`/`.xlsx`/`.pptx`.
Run the `inspect*` variant first if you want to know what's in a file before
deciding to clean it.

### `inspect` — report what's there, without touching the file

```bash
# Human-readable report
metaclean inspect photo.jpg

# Multiple files, machine-readable JSON (for scripting/CI)
metaclean inspect --json *.jpg *.png
```

Exits `0` if every file was clean and readable, `1` if any file has
findings or failed to parse — so `metaclean inspect *.jpg || echo "found metadata"`
works as a CI gate.

Example output:

```
$ metaclean inspect vacation.jpg
vacation.jpg  [Jpeg 4032x3024, 3841022 bytes]
  [gps] EXIF metadata with GPS location (2481 bytes)
  [icc-profile] ICC color profile (560 bytes)
```

`inspect` walks each format's container structure directly (JPEG APPn
markers, PNG chunks, WebP RIFF chunks) — it never decodes pixels, so it's
cheap and safe to run on files you haven't decided to trust yet.

### `clean` — strip it

```bash
# Clean a single image (writes photo-clean.jpg alongside the original)
metaclean clean photo.jpg

# Batch process many images at once
metaclean clean *.jpg *.png

# Write outputs to a specific directory
metaclean clean -o cleaned/ *.jpg

# Overwrite files in place
metaclean clean --in-place photo.jpg

# Skip the invisible pixel-fingerprint reset (metadata is still stripped)
metaclean clean --no-fingerprint-reset photo.jpg

# Tune the fingerprint reset (max per-channel delta, and fraction of pixels touched)
metaclean clean --fingerprint-strength 1 --fingerprint-fraction 0.5 photo.jpg

# Force output to a different container format
metaclean clean --format webp photo.png

# Control JPEG re-encode quality (1-100, default 92)
metaclean clean --jpeg-quality 90 photo.jpg

# Classical (Lanczos3) upscale — sharper resize, doesn't invent detail
metaclean clean --upscale 2.0 photo.jpg

# Real AI super-resolution (Real-ESRGAN, bundled model) — hallucinates
# plausible detail; meant for small/low-res images, capped at 1600px input
metaclean clean --ai-upscale photo.jpg

# Classical (non-AI) quality enhancement: auto-contrast + unsharp-mask
metaclean clean --enhance photo.jpg

# Machine-readable JSON output
metaclean clean --json *.jpg

# Tune the decompression-bomb guard (defaults: 256 MB input, 12000px per side, 512 MB decoded)
metaclean clean --max-input-mb 100 --max-dimension 8000 --max-decoded-mb 256 photo.jpg
```

Both subcommands share the same decompression-bomb guard flags
(`--max-input-mb`, `--max-dimension`; `clean` additionally has
`--max-decoded-mb`), so inspecting an untrusted file is exactly as safe as
cleaning one.

Run `metaclean --help`, `metaclean clean --help`, or `metaclean inspect --help`
for the full flag list.

### `inspect-text` / `clean-text` — text, Markdown, HTML

```bash
# Report invisible characters / frontmatter keys / meta+comments present
metaclean inspect-text notes.md page.html

# Strip them (writes notes-clean.md alongside the original)
metaclean clean-text notes.md page.html

# Also strip the zero-width joiner (off by default — it's what joins emoji
# into family/profession sequences, so it's kept unless you need it gone)
metaclean clean-text --strip-zero-width-joiner notes.md
```

For `.md` files, AI/tool-identifying frontmatter keys (`author`, `creator`,
`generator`, `model`, `prompt`, ...) are removed from the YAML frontmatter
block; every other key (`title`, `date`, `tags`, ...) is left untouched,
since frontmatter is often functionally required by a site generator, not
pure metadata. For `.html`/`.htm` files, identifying `<meta>` tags
(`generator`, `author`, `dc.creator`, ...) and non-conditional HTML comments
are removed; functional meta (`charset`, `viewport`, ...) and IE conditional
comments (`<!--[if IE]>...<![endif]-->`) are left alone. Every other
invisible/steganography-relevant character is always stripped from every
text file, regardless of extension.

### `inspect-doc` / `clean-doc` — DOCX, XLSX, PPTX

```bash
# Report identifying metadata present (author, company, custom properties)
metaclean inspect-doc report.docx

# Strip it (document content is untouched, byte-for-byte)
metaclean clean-doc report.docx budget.xlsx slides.pptx
```

All three OOXML formats share the same `docProps/core.xml`/`app.xml`/
`custom.xml` metadata parts, which is where author/company/last-modified-by/
custom tracking properties live; `clean-doc` blanks the text nodes in those
parts via a streaming XML rewrite while every other zip entry — including
the actual document content — is copied through unchanged.

### `serve` — local web UI

```bash
# Starts on http://127.0.0.1:7878 and opens it in your default browser
metaclean serve

# Different port, don't auto-open a browser tab
metaclean serve --port 9000 --no-open
```

Drag files onto the page (or pick them) — images, text/Markdown/HTML, and
Office documents can all be mixed in the same batch. Each file is inspected
automatically on drop, showing findings inline, and the Options panel
adapts to show only what's relevant to the file types actually present
(image options, text options, or a doc-options note — Office documents have
nothing to configure, everything identifying is always stripped). Then
"Clean & download all" cleans every file server-side (via the same
`metacleaner-core`/`metacleaner-text`/`metacleaner-docs` functions the CLI
uses) and downloads each result through the browser.

Binds to `127.0.0.1` (loopback) by default — nothing outside this machine
can reach it. `--host` exists to override this, but only do so if you
understand that anyone who can reach that address can then upload and
process files through it. There's no authentication: this is designed to
be a personal local tool, the same trust model as running a local Jupyter
notebook or dev server, not a multi-user service.

The HTML/CSS/JS are compiled into the `metaclean` binary itself
(`include_str!`) — `serve` needs nothing on disk beyond the binary, which
matters for shipping this as a single apt-installable package.

## Security: decompression-bomb guard

`clean()` rejects oversized or maliciously-crafted input before doing any
expensive work, in three layers:

1. **Raw byte size** — the CLI checks the file's size on disk (and the
   library checks `input.len()`) against `max_input_bytes` before reading or
   parsing anything.
2. **Declared dimensions** — a file's header can claim any width/height it
   wants regardless of how small the file actually is (e.g. a 65-byte PNG
   declaring a 60,000x60,000 canvas, which would need ~14 GB to decode).
   `metacleaner-core` reads each format's header via its own decoder, checks
   the declared dimensions against `max_image_dimension` via `image::Limits`,
   and rejects the file *before* allocating a pixel buffer.
3. **Decoded allocation size** — `max_decoded_bytes` bounds how much memory
   the decoder may allocate while reading pixel data, as a second, more
   general backstop.

All three are configurable via `CleanOptions` (library) or
`--max-input-mb` / `--max-dimension` / `--max-decoded-mb` (CLI), and can be
disabled individually by setting the corresponding `CleanOptions` field to
`None` if you trust your input source and want to process unusually large
legitimate images.

## What it removes

**Images:**
- EXIF (camera make/model, lens, ISO, aperture, shutter speed, software, timestamps)
- GPS / geotags
- XMP and IPTC (creator info, copyright, keywords, edit history)
- C2PA content credentials (Adobe Firefly, Photoshop, other Content Authenticity Initiative tools)
- Stable Diffusion generation parameters (Automatic1111, ComfyUI, Forge) stored in PNG `tEXt`/`iTXt`/`zTXt` chunks
- AI generator signatures embedded by DALL-E, Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, etc.
- The file's pixel-level fingerprint (optional, on by default)

**Text / Markdown / HTML:**
- Zero-width characters, bidi-control overrides, Unicode Tag block
  smuggling, and supplementary-plane variation-selector smuggling — the
  same techniques used to invisibly watermark LLM output, and (Unicode Tag
  block specifically) to smuggle hidden instructions past a reader, as in
  the 2025 "EchoLeak" prompt-injection attack on Microsoft 365 Copilot
  (CVE-2025-32711)
- Markdown YAML frontmatter keys that identify an author/tool/AI system
  (`author`, `creator`, `generator`, `model`, `prompt`, ...)
- HTML `<meta>` tags with the same identifying names, and non-conditional
  HTML comments

**Office documents (DOCX/XLSX/PPTX):**
- Author, last-modified-by, company, manager, title, keywords, comments,
  and any custom tracking properties in `docProps/core.xml`/`app.xml`/`custom.xml`

## What it can't remove

Only data stored in file metadata / non-pixel container chunks (for images)
or dedicated metadata parts/tags (for text and documents) is in scope.
Anything encoded into the pixels themselves — an invisible watermark such as
Google's SynthID, or signals a visual AI classifier looks for — is not
metadata and can't be stripped this way; the same goes for AI-text-detector
evasion (paraphrasing to defeat statistical detectors), which is out of
scope by design, not a gap. Treat this as a privacy/provenance tool, not a
guarantee against AI-content detectors.

Supported image formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, BMP, GIF, TIFF. HEIC/AVIF and
video are not yet supported.

**Animated GIFs and multi-page TIFFs are refused outright, not silently
truncated.** The `image` crate's public decoder API for both formats only
exposes "decode the first frame/page" — there's no way to ask "is there
more than one?" through it. Rather than quietly cleaning only page 1 of a
scanned document or frame 1 of an animation and discarding the rest,
`clean()` does its own bounds-checked structural scan first (GIF block
walk / TIFF IFD-chain walk) and returns a clear `MultiFrameNotSupported`
error if it finds more than one. `inspect` still works fine on these files
(it only reports on the first frame/page, never discards anything since it
doesn't write output).

## Testing

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

`metacleaner-core`'s tests build a PNG with a real Automatic1111-style
`parameters` tEXt chunk and assert it's absent from the cleaned output, among
other checks (format conversion, unsupported-format rejection, fingerprint
reset actually changing bytes, the decompression-bomb guard rejecting a PNG
header that declares a 60,000x60,000 canvas, a genuinely animated GIF and a
multi-page TIFF both being refused rather than silently truncated, and
`inspect()` correctly identifying GPS-bearing EXIF, C2PA/JUMBF segments,
Stable Diffusion parameters, and GIF comment/application extensions across
PNG, JPEG, GIF, and TIFF fixtures).

`metacleaner-text`'s tests cover each invisible-character category (zero-width
watermark patterns, bidi-override spoofing, Unicode Tag block smuggling,
supplementary variation selectors), zero-width-joiner emoji preservation,
frontmatter key stripping (including dash/underscore-insensitive matching
and leaving non-identifying keys untouched), and the HTML module (generator/
author `<meta>` stripping, plain-comment stripping, IE conditional-comment
preservation, and not mis-parsing a hypothetical `<metadata>` tag as `<meta>`).

`metacleaner-docs`'s tests, plus real-file verification against fixtures
generated with `python-docx`/`openpyxl`/`python-pptx`, confirm identifying
properties are blanked while document content and every other zip entry are
preserved byte-for-byte.

## Roadmap

- Automate apt-repo updates on release (currently a manual `cargo deb` +
  publish step) — a GitHub Actions workflow that rebuilds `Packages`/
  `Release`/`InRelease` and pushes a new `.deb` into `pool/main` on the
  `gh-pages` branch whenever a version is tagged.
- PDF `/Info` dictionary + XMP metadata stripping, and EPUB metadata
  stripping — remaining format coverage matching the fuller feature set of
  tools like `watermarks-remover`.
- Animated GIF / multi-page TIFF support — clean each frame/page instead of
  refusing the whole file (needs the multi-frame encode path, not just the
  single-frame one `clean()` uses today).
- HEIC/AVIF support.
- Real C2PA manifest parsing via the `c2pa` crate. Today `inspect` flags
  *that* a JPEG APP11 segment or PNG `caBX` chunk is present (C2PA's known
  homes in each container) but doesn't parse the JUMBF/manifest contents —
  so it can't yet tell you *who* signed a Content Credentials claim.
- Segment-preserving strip mode (via `img-parts`) that keeps the ICC profile
  and exact pixels while only dropping EXIF/XMP/C2PA segments, as an
  alternative to the current full re-encode for users who want zero
  quality/pixel change instead of a hash-busting fingerprint reset.
- `metacleaner-wasm`: a `wasm-bindgen` wrapper around `metacleaner-core`
  for a fully client-side, publicly-hostable web version (the `serve`
  subcommand's local server covers the "apt-installable local tool" use
  case; this would cover "deploy this as a public website" instead).
